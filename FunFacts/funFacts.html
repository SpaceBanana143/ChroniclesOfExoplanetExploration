                <p>In 1993, the planet PSR B1620-26b was found. It is the first planet discovered in a star cluster. Located 1,170 light years from Earth, it is 2.5 times the size of Jupiter and takes over 100 years to complete a single orbit.</p>

                <p>In 1995, 51 Pegasi b (also called "Dimidium") became the first exoplanet discovered orbiting a star similar to our Sun. This discovery confirmed that planets like those in our solar system could exist elsewhere in the universe.</p>

            <div class="col mx-3 note" id="note5">
                <p class="pt-5">In March 2005, a new type of direct observation of planets began, allowing astronomers to analyze the atmospheres, sizes and orbits of exoplanets.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col note" id="note6">
                <p>In March 2005, astronomers using the Spitzer Space Telescope announced the direct observation of infrared light from an exoplanet for the first time. The exoplanets that were emitting light were: HD 209458 and TrES-1.</p>

                <p class="pt-5">In May 2007, astronomers David Charbonneau and Heather Knutson, using the Spitzer Space Telescope, created the first map of an exoplanet’s surface. The rough map shows the temperature of cloud cover on the surface of HD 189733 b.</p>

            <div class="col mx-3 note" id="note8">
                <p>Kepler’s first rocky exoplanet and the smallest exoplanet found at the time was Kepler-10b, discovered in  January 2011. This planet is 1.4 times the size of Earth, has the density of an iron dumbbell, weighs 4.6 times the mass of Earth, and is extremely hot, orbiting more than 20 times closer to its star than Mercury is to our sun.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col note" id="note9">
                <p class="pt-5">Relying on data from the Kepler and Spitzer space telescopes, in September 2013 astronomers announced the creation of the first cloud map of an exoplanet – a scorching world 50% larger than Jupiter called Kepler-7b.</p>

            <div class="col py-2 note" id="note10">
                <p>The first Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within its star’s habitable zone - where liquid water could exist on a planetary surface - was revealed by the Kepler space telescope team in April 2014. Kepler-186f is just 10% larger than Earth, thought to be rocky, and orbits a star about half the size of our sun, approximately 500 light years away.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col mx-3 note" id="note11">
                <p>Kepler-452b, also known as Earth’s “bigger, older cousin,” is about 1.6 times the size of Earth. It became for its 385 – day orbit around a G2-type star, which is very similar to our own sun. While its true composition remains unknown,  it is believed that if the planet is rocky, it could have  liquid water on its surface.</p>

            <div class="col note" id="note12">
                <p class="pt-5">Kepler’s largest batch of planets was discovered in May 2016 when it found 1,284 new planets, almost 40% of which could be rocky planets with a composition similar to Earth’s.</p>

            <div class="col py-2 note" id="note13">
                <p>Our closest exoplanet, Proxima b, likely a rocky planet, was discovered in August 2016. It orbits our nearest neighboring star, Proxima Centauri, at a distance that could allow liquid water to form on its surface.</p>

                <p class="pt-5">The most studied planetary system, other than our own solar system, is the TRAPPIST-1 system, which is located about 40 light years away.</p>

            <div class="col note" id="note15">
                <p>In December 2017, an eighth planet system was found, named Kepler-90. Its configuration is similar to our solar system, with smaller planets orbiting close to their star, and larger planets found further away.</p>

                <p>The first – ever detection of helium, the second most common element, in an exoplanet’s atmosphere was made using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope in May 2018. Helium was discovered in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-107b, located more than 200 light years from Earth.</p>

                <p class="pt-5">In January 2019, the freshly launched TESS space telescope found its first three confirmed exoplanets: LHS 3844b, Pi Mensae C, and HD21749b.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col note" id="note18">
                <p>On June 13, 2019, NASA’s Exoplanet Archive announced 31 newly confirmed exoplanets discovered by ground and space – based telescopes, which brought the total number of confirmed exoplanets to over 4,000 for the first time.</p>

                <p>In March 2022, the count of confirmed exoplanets passed the 5,000 mark, representing a 30-year journey of discovery led by NASA’s space telescopes.</p><p class="pt-5">Most of the exoplanets orbit other stars, but there are some free-floating ones, called rogue planets, which are untethered to any star.</p>

                <p>The gas giant exoplanet 8 Ursae Minoris b has defied the odds! Orbiting a star 530 light years away that’s in its red giant phase, this planet should have been engulfed and destroyed by the star’s expansion. Yet, thanks to precise measurements by NASA's TESS and the study of stellar vibrations (known as asteroseismology), scientists discovered that the planet remains in a stable orbit. This surprising find shows just how unpredictable planet formation and destruction can be!</p>
