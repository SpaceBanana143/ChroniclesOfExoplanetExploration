						<h1 style="margin-top: 10px;">What is an exoplanet?</h1>
						<p style="margin:15px 5px 5px 25px; font-size: 17px;">An exoplanet is a planet that is outside our solar system. Exoplanets are typically found orbiting a star other than our Sun. In the same way that our solar system contains eight planets, other stars can have many exoplanets in orbit around them. Exoplanets are named after the stars they orbit. For example, the star TRAPPIST-1 has seven exoplanets in its system. Researchers have named them TRAPPIST-1b, TRAPPIST-1c, TRAPPIST-1d, and so on, up to TRAPPIST-1h.
							The lowercase letters are given to the exoplanets in order of their discovery date. If many exoplanets are discovered at the same time, the lowercase letters are assigned according to how close the exoplanets are to their host star.

						<h1>Types of exoplanets</h1>
						<p>
							<ul> 	
								<li><b>Hot Jupiters:</b> Large gas giants located very close to their host star, even closer than Mercury is to the Sun.</li>
								<li><b>Mini-Neptunes and Super-Earths:</b> Common exoplanets that can be oversized rocky planets or gas giants smaller than Neptune.</li>
								<li><b>Ocean Worlds:</b> Exoplanets with a rocky core completely covered by deep liquid oceans.</li>
								<li><b>Rocky Worlds:</b>Earth- or Mars-like planets with solid surfaces, potentially featuring small oceans or atmosphere</li>

						<h1>WASP-12b</h1>
						<p>The doomed planet WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter that orbits so close to its parent star, it's being torn apart. It takes this alien world only 1.1 days to completely circle its sun.
							The star's gravity also pulls material off the planet into a disk around the star. In 10 million years, this alien world could be completely consumed.
							Almost two times the size of our Jupiter, WASP-12b is a sizzling gas giant whose temperature is approximately 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,210 degrees Celsius). Gravity causes enormous tidal forces which are stretching the planet into the shape of an egg.
							WASP-12b is located roughly 1,200 light-years away in the constellation Auriga. </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/Trappist-1.jpg" alt=""  style="width: 285px;"/>
						<h1>The TRAPPIST-1 system</h1>
						<p>In 2015, a team of scientists announced they had discovered three exoplanets orbiting TRAPPIST-1, a star about 40 light-years away from Earth. After observing the system with more telescopes, they found four additional planets.
							All seven TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets (b, c, d, e, f, g and h) are rocky and similar in size to Earth. At least three of them are located in the star's habitable zone. 
							The TRAPPIST-1 system will be an important target for observation with the James Webb Space Telescope, to help researchers better understand other worlds.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/Kepler-22b.jpg" alt="" />
						<h1>Kepler-22b</h1>
						<p>Roughly twice the size of Earth, Kepler-22b was discovered in 2011 by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope. This exoplanet was the first found in any star's habitable zone.
							Although scientists are unsure what Kepler-22b looks like, it orbits its star at just the right distance—where conditions are most likely to allow any water on its surface to remain liquid.
      						This area is also called the Goldilocks Zone, since conditions are not too hot, not too cold, but just right. However, there are no guarantees this exoplanet, located about 600 light-years away, hosts alien life or that humans could live on it.
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/TinyTrio.webp" alt="" />
						<h1>The Tiny Trio of Exoplanets</h1>
						<p>Astronomers using data from NASA's Kepler mission have discovered the three smallest planets yet detected orbiting a star beyond our sun. The planets orbit a single star, called KOI-961, and are 0.78, 0.73 and 0.57 times the radius of Earth. The smallest is about the size of Mars.
							All three planets are thought to be rocky like Earth but orbit close to their star, making them too hot to be in the habitable zone, which is the region where liquid water could exist. The three planets are very close to their star, taking less than two days to orbit around it. </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/Proxima b.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Proxima Centauri b</h1>
						<p>At only four light-years away, Proxima Centauri b is our closest known exoplanet neighbor.
							Proxima b is a super Earth exoplanet that orbits a M-type star. Its mass is 1.27 Earths, it takes 11.2 days to complete one orbit of its star, and is 0.0485 AU from its star.
							In the habitable zone of its star, Proxima Centauri, Proxima b encounters bouts of extreme ultraviolet radiation hundreds of times greater than Earth does from the Sun. That radiation generates enough energy to strip away not just the lightest molecules — hydrogen — but also, over time, heavier elements such as oxygen and nitrogen.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/WASP18b_1280.webp" alt="" />
						<h1>WASP-18 b</h1>
						<p>WASP-18 b is a gas giant exoplanet 10 times more massive than Jupiter that orbits its star in just 23 hours. Researchers used NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to study the planet as it moved behind its star. Temperatures there reach 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,700 C).
							Scientists identified water vapor in the atmosphere of WASP-18 b, and made a temperature map of the planet as it slipped behind, and reappeared from, its star. The same side, known as the dayside, of WASP-18 b always faces the star, just as the same side of the Moon always faces Earth.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/Kepler-186f.webp" alt="" />
						<h1>Kepler-186f</h1>
						<p>The first validated Earth-size planet to orbit a distant star in the habitable zone -- a range of distance from a star where liquid water might pool on the planet's surface. The discovery of Kepler-186f confirms that Earth-size planets exist in the habitable zones of other stars and signals a significant step closer to finding a world similar to Earth.
							The size of Kepler-186f is known to be less than ten percent larger than Earth, but its mass, composition and density are not known. Kepler-186f orbits its star once every 130 days and receives one-third the energy that Earth does from the sun, placing it near the outer edge of the habitable zone.
						</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<img src="images/K2-141.webp" alt="" />
						<h1>K2-141</h1>
						<p>This discovery includes a super Earth five times Earth's mass, that orbits an orange Sun-like star. This planet takes only six hours to orbit its K-type star, a journey that takes Mercury 88 days, making it a hot inferno world! K2-141 b is denser than Earth because of its greater mass and its larger iron core. It also has a Neptune-size companion that takes about eight days to orbit the same star.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/HD189733b.webp" alt="" />
						<h1>HD 189733b</h1>
						<p>A huge gas giant that orbits very close to its host star, HD 189733. The planet's atmosphere is scorching with a temperature of over 1,000 degrees Celsius, and it rains glass, sideways, in howling 4,300 mph (7,000 kph) winds. 
							At a distance of 63 light-years from us, this turbulent alien world is one of the nearest exoplanets to Earth that can be seen crossing the face of its star. By observing this planet before, during and after it disappeared behind its host star during orbit, astronomers were able to deduce that HD 189733b is a deep, azure blue reminiscent of Earth's color as seen from space.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/toi700e.webp" alt="" style="width: 300px; margin-left: 10px;" />
						<h1>TOI 700e</h1>
						<p>Using data from NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, scientists have identified an Earth-size world, called TOI 700 e, orbiting within the habitable zone of its star – the range of distances where liquid water could occur on a planet’s surface. The world is 95% Earth’s size and likely rocky.
							Astronomers previously discovered three planets in this system, called TOI 700 b, c, and d. Planet d also orbits in the habitable zone.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/KELT9b.webp" alt="" />
						<h1>KELT-9</h1>
						<p>KELT-9 is one of the hottest gas giant planets discovered so far.
							With a dayside temperature of more than 7,800 degrees Fahrenheit (4,600 Kelvin), KELT-9b is a planet that is hotter than most stars. But its star, called KELT-9, is even hotter – a blue A-type star that is likely unraveling the planet through evaporation.
							KELT-9b is a gas giant 2.8 times more massive than Jupiter, but only half as dense. Scientists would expect the planet to have a smaller radius, but the extreme radiation from its host star has caused the planet's atmosphere to puff up like a balloon.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/Hoth.webp" alt="" />
						<h1>OGLE-2005-BLG-390</h1>
						<p>The planet OGLE-2005-BLG-390, nicknamed Hoth, is a cold super-Earth that might be a failed Jupiter. Unable to grow large enough, it had to settle for a mass five times that of Earth and a surface locked in the deepest of deep freezes, with a surface temperature estimated at minus 364 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 220 Celsius).
							The planet lies toward the heart of the Milky Way, where a greater density of stars makes microlensing events more likely.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/K2-229 b.webp" alt="" />
						<h1>K2-229 b</h1>
						<p>This new discovery resembles our solar system's innermost planet, but much bigger. K2-229 b is like Mercury on steroids; about the size of Earth, it's four times bigger and five times hotter. It orbits a star like our Sun, but the day side of the planet can get up to temperatures hot enough to vaporize rock– around 3,700 degrees Fahrenheit (2,000 Celsius). Like Mercury, K2-229 b is made mostly of heavy elements, like iron and nickle.
							 These heavy elements can survive being close to the heat of a star. And unlike the Earth which is only 35 percent iron, K2-229 b, like Mercury, is 70 percent iron.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/K2-18b.webp" alt="" />
						<h1>K2-18b</h1>
						<p>K2-18b is now the only super-Earth exoplanet known to host both water and temperatures that could support life. UCL researchers used archive data from 2016 and 2017 captured by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and developed open-source algorithms to analyze the starlight filtered through K2-18b’s atmosphere. The results revealed the molecular signature of water vapor, also indicating the presence of hydrogen and helium in the planet’s atmosphere.
						   K2-18 b orbits the cool dwarf star K2-18 in the habitable zone and lies 120 light-years from Earth in the constellation Leo. 
						</p>

					<div>
						<img src="images/Kepler 20e.webp" alt="" style="width: 190px; margin-left: 70px;" />
						<h1>Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f</h1>
						<p>NASA's Kepler mission has discovered the first Earth-size exoplanets, Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f, orbiting a sun-like star. Although too close to their star to be in the habitable zone for liquid water, they are the smallest confirmed planets around a sun-like star. Kepler-20f, with an orbital period of 20 days and a scorching surface temperature of 800°F, is the closest object to Earth in size but too hot to support life as we know it.</p>
						<img src="images/Kepler-20f.webp" alt="" style="width: 190px; margin-left: 70px;" />
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/TOI_1338b.webp" alt="" />
						<h1>TOI 1338 b</h1>
						<p>TOI 1338 b, TESS’s first circumbinary planet, orbits two stars in the constellation Pictor, about 1,300 light-years away. TOI 1338 b, the only known planet in its system, is about 6.9 times larger than Earth and experiences regular stellar eclipses due to its orbit in the same plane as its stars.
							The two stars orbit each other every 15 days—one is 10% more massive than the Sun, while the other is a cooler, dimmer star. Detecting transits of TOI 1338 b is challenging, occurring irregularly every 93 to 95 days, with variations in depth due to the stars' orbital motion. </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/GJ 486b.jpg" alt=""/>
						<h1>GJ 486 b</h1>
						<p>The rocky exoplanet GJ 486 b orbits a red dwarf star that is only 26 light-years away in the constellation Virgo. By observing GJ 486 b transit in front of its star, astronomers sought signs of an atmosphere. They detected hints of water vapor. However, they caution that while this might be a sign of a planetary atmosphere, the water could be on the star itself – specifically, in cool starspots – and not from the planet at all.
							GJ 486 b is about 30% larger than the Earth and weighs three times as much. It orbits its star closely in just under 1.5 days. </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/Vhs1256b.jpg" alt=""/>
						<h1>VHS 1256 b</h1>
						<p>The planet is about 40 light-years away and orbits two stars that are locked in their own tight rotation.

							Its clouds are constantly rising, mixing, and moving during its 22-hour day. Plus, they’re filled with silicate dust. Some clouds contain silicate grains as tiny as smoke particles. Other contain slightly larger flecks that are similar to small grains of sand. Researchers detected both brighter and darker cloud patches, indicating some clouds are lower and hotter or higher and cooler than others, respectively.
							
							VHS 1256 b is about four times farther from its stars than Pluto is from our Sun.</p>
